## Download

You can download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/Sasye/EIEM/releases) or compile it yourself from source.

> Use [Applepie Manager](https://github.com/Sasye/ApplepieManager) to easily manage and configure this plugin.

## Installation

Copy the following files into the game directory (the folder containing `Endfield.exe`):

```
bin/eiem.dll             → game_dir/plugin/eiem.dll
bin/vulkan-1.dll         → game_dir/vulkan-1.dll
bin/d3dcompiler_47.dll   → game_dir/d3dcompiler_47.dll
```

> **Note**: `d3dcompiler_47.dll` (DX environment) and `vulkan-1.dll` (Vulkan environment) are proxy loaders. You can place either one or both. If you already use another plugin that shares a proxy loader (such as [AntiKick](https://github.com/Sasye/EndFieldAntiKick), [SynchroFocus](https://github.com/Sasye/EndfieldSynchroFocus), or [EndfieldCombatHUD](https://github.com/Sasye/EndfieldCombatHUD), etc.), there is no need to place the proxy loader again.

> If you have **never installed a plugin of this type before**, you may need to create the `plugin` folder yourself.

## Preparing Resource Files

Auto-scans `game_dir/plugin/` or manually specify the following files:

| File | Description | Required |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `muscle_anim.bin` | MUS4-format motion data (exported via ExportMuscleAnimation.cs) | **Yes** |
| `*.vmd` | VMD file (facial expression morph data) | Optional (auto-scans .vmd in plugin dir) |
| `camera.vmd` | Camera motion data | Optional |
| `bgm.wav` or `bgm.mp3` | Background music | Optional |

## Usage

1. Install as described above, launch the game, and enter the game.
2. Press **Insert** to open the GUI panel.
3. Load the desired files, then click the **Play** button on the "Control" tab to start playback.

## Motion Export (VMD → MUS4)

You must first convert VMD animations to MUS4 format (`muscle_anim.bin`) using the Unity editor.

### Prerequisites

- Unity Editor
- [MMD4Mecanim](https://stereoarts.jp/#:~:text=MMD4Mecanim_Beta_20200105.zip) — converts VMD to Unity AnimationClip
- Any Humanoid MMD model

### Steps

1. Place `ExportMuscleAnimation.cs` into your Unity project's `Assets/Editor/` folder
2. Import an MMD model (set to Humanoid Rig) and use MMD4Mecanim to convert a VMD file into an AnimationClip
3. Create an Animator Controller and add the converted AnimationClip as the default state
4. Assign the Animator Controller to the model in the scene
5. **Select the model**, then click `Tools > Export Muscle Animation` in the menu bar
6. The exported file `Assets/muscle_anim.bin` will be created — copy it to the game's `plugin/` directory

> Facial expressions do not go through this export — simply place the original `.vmd` file in the `plugin/` directory and the plugin will parse the morph data automatically.
