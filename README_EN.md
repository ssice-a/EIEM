# EIEM: Endfield Resource Replacement

English | [中文](README.md)

EIEM is an in-game resource replacement plugin for *Arknights: Endfield*. It replaces meshes, materials, and textures by source resource identity. Mod authors can extract source assets with [AnimeStudio](https://github.com/ssice-a/AnimeStudio), then edit and export a Mod with the [EIEM Blender add-on](https://github.com/ssice-a/EIEM-blender). Players installing an existing Mod do not need either authoring tool.

The development version may differ from a published build. Follow the notes for the Release you install.

## Features

- Replace meshes, materials, textures, and declared material parameters. One mesh can contain multiple submeshes and material slots.
- Apply the same resource rules to world characters, character UI, and NPCs, including authored LOD rules.
- Keep each Mod's switch and shape state separate. The in-game manager provides key buttons and shape sliders.
- Press F10 to reload Mod configuration and resources for registered instances. Invalid configuration leaves the previous valid version active.
- Configure the manager and reload shortcuts, as well as camera fade behavior, in the global INI.
- Check this repository's Releases when the Mod manager opens; defer or ignore a specific version.

## Download and install

Download the DLL package from **[EIEM Releases](https://github.com/ssice-a/EIEM/releases)**. Exit the game, then extract the ZIP into the directory containing `Endfield.exe`:

```text
game directory/
├─ d3dcompiler_47.dll      # DirectX proxy loader
├─ vulkan-1.dll            # Vulkan proxy loader
└─ plugin/
   ├─ eiem.dll
   ├─ eiem.ini             # Global settings; created with defaults if absent
   └─ mods/
      └─ SomeMod/
         ├─ mod.ini
         └─ ...            # Preserve the Mod's resource folder structure
```

Install either or both proxy loaders as appropriate for your graphics setup. If another plugin already supplies a compatible loader with the same filename, check how it loads plugins before replacing it. Create `plugin` and `mods` if needed. [Applepie Manager](https://github.com/Sasye/ApplepieManager) is optional.

To install a Mod, put the **folder containing `mod.ini`** directly inside `plugin/mods/`. Avoid an extra nested folder after extracting the archive. To update EIEM, exit the game first, replace the DLL and any necessary loader, and keep your own `plugin/eiem.ini` and `plugin/mods/`.

## Use in game

1. Start the game and enter a scene containing the target character. Matching Mods apply automatically.
2. Press **Insert** to open the Mod manager. Select a Mod to use its key buttons and shape sliders. Static Mods without controls can still apply automatically.
3. Press **F10** after editing or adding Mod files to reload them.

Shortcuts can be changed in `plugin/eiem.ini`:

```ini
[Hotkeys]
reload=F10
gui=INSERT

[Graphics]
disable_camera_fade=true
```

After editing a shortcut, press the **old reload shortcut once** to load the new setting. See the [configuration guide](docs/conditional-keys.md) for Mod rules and additional keys.

## Make a Mod

1. Open the game's VFS in AnimeStudio, select a Prefab, and export an EIEM source package.
2. Install and enable the EIEM Blender add-on, then import the source package's `mod.ini`.
3. Edit meshes, materials, textures, switches, or shapes. Select the target meshes and export an EIEM Mod package.
4. Place the exported folder in `plugin/mods/`, then press F10 in game to check the result.

See the [AnimeStudio guide](tools/README.md) and [Blender add-on guide](https://github.com/ssice-a/EIEM-blender#readme) for detailed steps.

## TODO

- Complete cold-start and repeated hot-reload validation in world, character UI, and NPC contexts.
- Complete native assembly of added bones, physics bones, and colliders.
- Extend game-version compatibility checks and validation of all three release packages.
